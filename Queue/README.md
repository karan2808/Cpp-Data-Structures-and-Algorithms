1. Circular queue is a linear data structure in which operations are performed based on FIFO,  (First In First Out) principle and the last element's position is connected back to the first elements position. It is also called a Ring Buffer. This variation of the standard queue enables us to add elements to the front of the queue once they have been removed. In a normal queue, once the queue is full, we cannot insert the next element in front even if there is extra space to do so.

2. Circular deque is similar to the circular queue, but allows insertion and deletion from both front and rear of the queue. 

3. Program to find the Kth Largest element in an array or a vector.
